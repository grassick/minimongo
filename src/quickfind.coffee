###

Quickfind protocol allows sending information about which rows are already present locally to minimize
network traffic.

Protocal has 3 phases:

encodeRequest: Done on client. Summarize which rows are already present locally by sharding and then hashing _id:_rev|
encodeResponse: Done on server. Given complete server list and results of encodeRequest, create list of changes, sharded by first two characters of _id
decodeResponse: Done on client. Given encoded response and local list, recreate complete list from server.

Interaction of sort, limit and fields:

- fields present: _rev might be missing. Do not use quickfind
- limit with no sort: This gives unstable results. Do not use quickfind
- sort: final rows need to be re-sorted. Since fields not present, is possible.
- no sort, no limit: always sort by _id

shardLength = 2

# Given an array of client rows, create a summary of which rows are present
exports.encodeRequest = (clientRows) ->

  return request

  # Index by shard

  # Include any that are in encoded request but not present
  for key, value of encodedRequest
    if not serverRows[key]
      serverRows[key] = []

  # Only keep ones where different from encoded request
  response = _.pickBy(serverRows, (rows, key) -> hashRows(rows) != encodedRequest[key])

  return response
